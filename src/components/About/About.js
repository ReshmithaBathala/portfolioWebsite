          Hello! Iâ€™m Reshmitha Bathala, a passionate and dedicated Full-stack
          Developer based in Andhra Pradesh, India. I am currently pursuing my
          Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Jawaharlal
          Nehru Technological University, Ananthapur, while also acquiring
          industry-ready certification in Full-stack Development from Nxtwave
          Disruptive Technologies. With a solid foundation in both frontend and
          backend technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js,
          Python, Express, and Node.js, I have developed a range of web
          applications that showcase my skills. From creating innovative
          e-commerce platforms like Nxt Trendz to developing comprehensive job
          search tools such as Jobby App, I have demonstrated my ability to
          design user-friendly interfaces and ensure secure, efficient
          functionality. My projects, including a productivity-enhancing Todos
          Application and a full-featured food ordering website FoodHunch,
          reflect my commitment to delivering high-quality, user-centric
          solutions. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills and experience
          to contribute to impactful projects and collaborate with
          forward-thinking teams.
